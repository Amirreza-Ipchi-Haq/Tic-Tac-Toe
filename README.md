This is not just a 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe program! With this, you can set as many cells as you like (if the Columns & Rows are equal). If you have "***n***" Columns & Rows (as an example), the first player to get ***n*** of his/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
<br>Remember that this is a Multiplayer game (I had no idea how to set an AI).
